# Cross platform mobile competition

The same demo app built with three different cross platform technologies: Flutter, React Native & Xamarin.

## The app

The project consists in an iOS & Android app with two tabs:
1. *Photos*: it's a carousel list with high quality photos fetched from [Unsplash](https://https://unsplash.com/). The user can tap on a photo and add it to favourites, assigning a title and tags.
2. *Favourites*: a grid list with all the photos marked as favourite. When the user taps on a photo, a modal is shown with the title, the image and the tags.
